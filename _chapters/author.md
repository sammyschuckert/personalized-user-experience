Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm [@sammyschuckert](https://twitter.com/sammyschuckert/) a 27-year-old UX Designer working at IBM. I was born and raised in [Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Heidelberg/) and graduated with an M.A. in strategic design from the [HfG Schwaebisch Gmuend](http://www.hfg-gmuend.de/) last year.

I co-founded a sharing economy startup called [thangs â€“ stuffsharing with friends](http://www.thangsapp.com) during my studies in 2016. Therefore, my friends would describe me as an advocate of the [#sharingeconomy](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sharingeconomy) and a part-time [#digitalnomad](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalnomad) â€“ not the one who is living 24/7 at the beach. ðŸ˜‰

Besides that, I'm a huge Star Wars and Pixar fan, have a deep passion for technology and everything that's digital. It is my belief that human-centered design methods are the key to solving some of the biggest challenges we face today.
